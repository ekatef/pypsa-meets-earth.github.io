# PyPSA meets Africa website

The "PyPSA meets Africa" website can be used as template for your own purpose.
We built it using the following features:


- Bootstrap template:
    Template Name: Bocor
    Template URL: https://bootstrapmade.com/bocor-bootstrap-template-nice-animation/
    Author: BootstrapMade.com
- TSparticles: https://particles.js.org/ for the Africa particle map
- Google forms for the newsletter
- Flickr for some pictures 
- Logomakr for vector logos

As code environment, we had code experience using VScode and the "Live Server" add-on.
